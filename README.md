## Description

In this project I have created a website for Rainy Days. Rainy Days is an online shop selling men’s and women’s rain jackets. The jackets are designed for a range of different outdoor activates such as hiking, skiing, and kayaking. The main goal for the site is to encourage viewers to purchase a jacket.
